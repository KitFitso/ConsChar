“Eat altitude, sucker!”

## Rocket Charge (Personal Mobility)

As an action, you grip the rod and launch in a straight line up to 60 feet, dragging yourself with it like a magical rocket-javelin.

You can fly through the air in a line, potentially striking targets in your path.

## Line Attack (Rocket Lance):

Any creatures in a 5-foot-wide line must make a DC 14 Dexterity save or take:

3d6 fire damage

Pushed 5 feet and fall prone

Ends at first solid object or after 60 ft.

"Like riding a missile... but more personal."
